Request App was built to increase the efficiency of how an enterprise handles internal requests. It achieves this by managing and tracking requests for a variety of departments while providing a single location where employees can submit service requests for their specific departments.

It also provides a single application for fulfillers/management to view, approve, or reject requests that can be organized and filtered by multiple criteria.

The goal of this app is to simplify the request submission process in a business while also making sure that these requests are addressed in an organized fashion. Request can retire prior forms of requests that are commonly used such as emails, spreadsheets and ideas brought up in meetings while automating many of the approval steps required for request to go through. 

The Request App table is extended from the Task table and features:
1. Custom Tables, Modules, and Forms.
2. Client Scripts, UI Policies, and UI Policy Actions.
3. Business Rules, On Demand Script Includes, and Extended Script Includes.
4. Custom Roles, Groups, Access Controls, Runtime Access Tracking, and Application Access.
5. Custom Flows, Approvals/Rejections, and Flow Logic.
6. Scheduled Script Execution, Scripted Event Generation, and Script Actions.

To view Request App you will need to import the application into a Personal Developer Instance(PDI).
