Request App

Request will manage and track requests for a variety of departments while providing a single location where all employees can submit service requests for their specific departments.

The goal of this app is to simplify the request submission process in a business while also making sure that these requests are addressed in a organized fashion. Request can retire prior forms of requests that are commonly used such as emails, spreadsheets and ideas brought up in meetings while automating many of the approval steps required for request to go through. 

The Request App table is extended from the Task table and features:
1. Custom Tables, Modules, and Forms
2. Client Scripts, UI Policies, and UI Policy Actions
3. Business Rules, On Demand Script Includes, and Extended Script Includes
4. Custom Roles, Groups, Access Controls, Runtime Access Tracking, and Application Access
5. Custom Flows, Approvals/Rejections, and Flow Logic 
6. Scheduled Script Execution, Scripted Event Generation, and Script Actions
