Request App was built to increase the efficiency of how an enterprise handles internal requests. It achieves this by managing and tracking requests for a variety of departments while providing a single location where employees can submit service requests for their specific departments.

It also provides a single application for fulfillers/management to view, approve, or reject requests that can be organized and filtered by multiple criteria.

The goal of this app is to simplify the request submission process in a business while also making sure that these requests are addressed in an organized fashion. Request can retire prior forms of requests that are commonly used such as emails, spreadsheets and ideas brought up in meetings while automating many of the approval steps required for request to go through. 

The Request App table is extended from the Task table and features:

1. Custom tables, application menu, modules, and form layout tailored to solve the business problem.
2. Client-side scripts using GlideForm and GlideUser Classes, UI Policies, and UI Policy Actions.
3. Server-side scripts including Business Rules, Script Includes, and Extended GlideAjax Script Includes.
4. Custom Flows, Triggers, Approvals/Rejections, and If/Else Flow Logic using Flow Designer.
5. Scheduled Script Execution, Scripted Event Generation, and Script Actions.
6. Secure through Custom Roles, Groups, Access Controls, Runtime Access Tracking, and Application Access.

To view Request App you will need to import the application into a Personal Developer Instance(PDI).
