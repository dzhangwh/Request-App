Request App

Request will manage and track requests for a variety of departments while providing a single location where all employees can submit service requests for their specific departments.

The goal of this app is to simplify the request submission process in a business while also making sure that these requests are addressed in a organized fashion. Request can retire prior forms of requests that are commonly used such as emails, spreadsheets and ideas brought up in meetings while automating many of the approval steps required for request to go through.
